Final Project for predicted the winner of two MLB teams
This is my final project on how i was able to predict the winner of two MLB teams
First things first you will need to download R if you do not have R.
Next you will have to download all the files given here. 
From there you will have to sort everything into a directory on your desktop.
Then you will start R.
Once R has booted up you will have to change the working directory to whereever the data you downloaded is located.
You then want to import the .R code and import the data from excel.
Last but not least you will run the program to determine which of the two teams that you chose and see who is predicted to win.
If you get lost look in the file under step 4 for final and there is a screenshot that can help you if you get lost.
